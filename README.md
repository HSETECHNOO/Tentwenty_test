# tentwenty_test

A new Flutter project for tentwenty.

## Getting Started


1. Offline-First and Online Functionality:  

   The application will seamlessly support both offline and online modes. Using Moor(Drift) for local caching, the app will efficiently persist data and synchronize updates
    when the device reconnects to the internet.  

3. State Management:  
   To ensure maintainability and scalability, I will implement the Provider architecture for state management. This is a well-known and highly efficient solution that integrates seamlessly with Flutterâ€™s ecosystem.  

4. Clean Architecture Pattern:
   I will follow a Change Notifier-based clean architecture pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns, enabling  testability and maintainability.  

5. Performance Optimization:
   The app will leverage Dio for networking, providing advanced features such as interceptors and custom adapters for efficient API integration. I will also employ efficient widgets and components to minimize resource consumption and improve app performance.  

6. Key Flutter Components and Plugins:
   - Streams   for handling real-time data updates.  
   - Platform Channels  for any platform-specific functionality.  
   - Modern and well-tested third-party packages to reduce development time while ensuring reliability.  

By integrating these components and practices, the app will be highly efficient, user-friendly, and robust. Please let me know if you have any additional requirements or specific details to include.  

Looking forward to your feedback.
